5,"We had a past experience with Denodo Mortgage and would without question use again and again if needed!! Denodo went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money.

5,"I can't express how grateful I am for the support that Jennifer Lopez provided to me and my family during this home purchase! His customer service, responsiveness and professional demeanor is second to none. He was very thorough and took the time to educate me about the process along the way. I highly recommend working with Jennifer Lopez and Denodo Capital!",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,"I had the pleasure of working with Denodo Capital in September 2018 as my family and I were making a home purchase in Columbus, OH. From the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing, the entire team from Denodo was very responsive and professional. I was VERY impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying (and selling) can be",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,"My experience with Mattison was beyond greatly professionally done!! She really cares about her clients needs! She stays on top of everything and if there was a misunderstanding, she would be on top of it for you. Overall she truly bends her back professionally for her clients. She is a wonderful person!",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,Patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure I got the right loan for my situation. The portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with 2 weeks. Very pleased with the customer service and intend on using Patrick again when we refinance later!!!!,Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,"I loved working with this group of people! They laughed with me over the phone! Always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible! Knowledgeable staff! While we were shopping around for a lender, one lender badmouthed Denodo, they lost my business because of it. When I told Denodo about it, they had the class not to say anything negative about another company, just to get the ""sell""",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,Great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features. Quick responses to any questions or concerns. Willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email...as phone calls weren't always an option for us.,Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,"Working with Michelle and Denodo went really well for me. As a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance, I feel that this process was smooth and successful. I will definitely recommend Michelle to friends and family.",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,"usten Butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. Not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and I will ever make. We didn't simply want to transact with a faceless institution. A lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. Austen was there for us, every step of the way. It's true. Austen got us the best deal. Yes, that's also true. But it's more than that. From when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. It's made a HUGE difference for our family, we're right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn't be happier - and it's all thanks to Austen Butler's help.",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,Jay was easy to get a hold of if I had any questions so that was huge to me because there's a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything's right. He provided as great a service as I could've wanted,Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,If I had a million Friends I would recommend all of them to Denodo capital especially to Mark Taylor he’s great he really help with even of the clock thanks a million mark I mean that from heart I appreciate everything you did for me.,Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,"Chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs. I had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of Chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues I had. He was the glue that kept this deal together. I did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet Chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end. Again, cannot say enough positive things about Chaz. Consummate professional and very responsive. I would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunities",Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,Austen has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase. He explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the B.S other companies use to get your business . Being a repeat customer says it all.,Denodo Capital Mortgage
5,The salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him I'm looking for a heloc specifically. Then he hangs up on me because I said I was quoted a better rate at TD bank. Ridiculous....,Denodo Capital Mortgage
1,"This was the worst experience ever. It was like they had never gone through the process before. I could not get a complete list of the documents required. Every other day it was a new request. The appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes I had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections. Wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again. There were many documents that I had to send 3 and 4 times because they ""lost"" them or was not filed correctly, we went through 4 different people through the process. I would NEVER use them. Awful experience!",Denodo Capital Mortgage
1,"A good rate but a very frustrating process, constant delays, decisions made then changed, overwhelmed underwriting team with 3 week back log, rookie mistake related to Texas law that caused an additional 2 week wait. Closing happened almost 6 weeks after it should have. Courteous and professional, but not very knowledgeable and no sense of urgency. Would not recommend",Denodo Capital Mortgage
1,"They were not upfront. Learn from my mistake... I trusted the loan officer that my zero point rate is an option before closing the loan because he convinced me to initially sign the Good Faith Estimate with higher rate plus lender's credit. After running my numbers, the lower interest is favorable for me and asking for it now, I'm being charge points. It looks like they are only good in their words at the beginning so please be careful dealing with this lender",Denodo Capital Mortgage
1,"Initially, the Mortgage Broker was very friendly and assertive. Once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent, it became increasingly difficult to reach the broker. I had to initiate all phone calls. It seemed as if I had to call to make the process move forward. It took four weeks to get a copy of my closing documents and the payoff for my credit card",Denodo Capital Mortgage
