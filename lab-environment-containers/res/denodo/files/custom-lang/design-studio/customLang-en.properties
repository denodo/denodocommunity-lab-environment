multidimensional.createBaseView.hierarchies.info=Configure some advanced options for each hierarchy and variable (if selected) included in the base view.\n\nThe default options are appropriate for most cases so, if you are unsure about the best option, click 'Ok' to continue. You can always reimport the base view later using the 'Source refresh' option.
multidimensional.createBaseView.info=Browse the tree below to select the element you want to import. Then click the "Create selected" button to access the next screen and select the dimensions and measures to import.
multidimensional.createBaseView.measures=Measures

multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputCaptions.help=Member Captions. This option allows selecting how the dimension members will be represented in the data returned by the base view. If this option is checked, the members will be represented by using its caption. Captions usually have more business-friendly values but may be ambiguous (duplicated captions could exist)
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputIncludeEmptyRows=Include empty rows
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputLeafLabelOnly=Leaf Label Only
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputLeafLabelOnly.help=Leaf Label Only. When this option is enabled, the base view will only include the leaf members of the hierarchy. For instance, if a 'Product' hierarchy has the members 'Electronics', 'Electronics/TV' and 'Electronics/Phone', then the view will contain the members 'TV' and 'Phone', but will not include the 'Electronics' member
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputLeafMembersOnly=Leaf Members Only
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputLeafMembersOnly.help=Leaf Members Only. When this option is enabled, the base view will only include the leaf members of the hierarchy and, for each included member, only the leaf label will be shown. For instance, if a 'Product' hierarchy has the members 'Electronics', 'Electronics/TV' and 'Electronics/Phone', then the view will contain only one column for the hierarchy with the values 'TV' and 'Phone'
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputMemberkeys=Member Keys
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputMemberkeys.help=Member Keys. When this option is enabled, the base view will contain an additional column for the dimension showing the full technical name of the member. Notice the full technical name is different from the technical key. An example of technical key would be 'TELEVISION' while the equivalent full technical name could be '[HIER_PRODUCT].[TELEVISION]'
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputMemberLeaves=Member Leaves
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputMemberLeaves.help=Member Leaves. When this option is enabled, the base view will contain an additional column for the hierarchy, showing the leaf component of the member. For instance, if we are using captions for representing members, for 'Electronics/TV', the column could show 'TV', while for 'Electronics', it could show 'Electronics'. This option is specially useful when the imported cube (or BeX Query) includes ragged dimensions. The option only can be applied when the include leaf levels only option is unchecked for the hierarchy
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputTechnicalName=Technical Keys
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.inputTechnicalName.help=Technical Keys. This option allows selecting how the dimension members will be represented in the data returned by the base view. If this option is checked, the members will be represented by using its technical key. If the option is left unchecked, then the members caption will be used. Captions usually have more business-friendly values but may be ambiguous (duplicated captions could exist)
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.leafLevelMembersOnly=Include leaf levels of hierarchies only
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.variables.asTechnicalName=Variable As Technical Name
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.variables.asTechnicalName.help=When this option is enabled, the conditions over fields that represents SAP variables are treated as technical keys
multidimensional.createBaseView.options.variables.name=Variable
multidimensional.createBaseView.popup.info=Select the dimensions and measures you want to import.\n\nNote: when you select hierarchies from two or more dimensions, the view will execute a cross-join of the selected dimensions, resulting in a cartesian product of their members. Because of this, be careful when selecting many hierarchies as it could lead to queries that the multidimensional database cannot handle or are too slow.
